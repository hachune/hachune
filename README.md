## hachune vision

Hachune is new web application framework thinking about future.

There are alot of web application frameworks on the web today, but using them, you will write a duplicate code among users, and it required alot of specialized knowledge.

It's a waste.

At least 80% of professional knowledge can be absorted by tha web application framework.

Hachune is aiming for it.
